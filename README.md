## 🧠 WELCOME_HOME

Solo Developer / Narrative Designer / Systems Integrator**

An experimental psychological horror terminal built with Python and Streamlit.  
WELCOME_HOME explores themes of memory corruption, identity recursion, and emotional manipulation — wrapped in a glitch-soaked UI inspired by late-night system errors and analog dread.

## 🧬 Core Features

- **Loop Tracking System**: Tracks analyst sessions and evolves narrative responses.
- **Glitch-Based UI**: CRT overlays, flicker text, scanlines, and jumpscare effects for immersive unease.
- **Reactive Dialogue Engine**: Elowen's responses shift based on your loop count and interaction style.
- **Memory Unlock Minigames**: Input hidden codes to recover redacted logs and unlock deeper truths.
- **Archetype-Driven Journal System**: AI-predictive narrative entries based on user behavior.
- **True Ending Mechanic**: Reaching a clean loop unlocks a final system override sequence.

## ⚠️ AI Assistance Disclosure

Parts of this project were built with AI-assisted tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) for:
- Brainstorming dialogue options and glitch effects
- Debugging tricky errors and modularizing code
- Speeding up prototype logic and UX design patterns

All code was reviewed, modified, and structured by me.  
This project represents original narrative design, creative direction, and system integration — with AI used as a collaborator, not a replacement.

## 📁 File Highlights

- `app.py` — main entry script, session control, and flow routing  
- `elowen_terminal.py` — primary user interface for Elowen’s dialogue  
- `interaction_logger.py` — logs and tracks memory corruption and session traits  
- `ui_effects.py` — glitch styles, CRT overlays, and fake reboot sequences  
- `journal_generator.py` — creates personalized journal entries based on archetype  
- `data/` — stores loop state, session logs, journal entries, and redacted files

## 🌀 Final Note

WELCOME_HOME is meant to be unsettling.  
If you finish all loops, ask yourself:  
**“Did I really make it out?”**
